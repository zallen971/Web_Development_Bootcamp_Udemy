    <h1>About ME</h1>
    <img src="./Assets/Images/Profile-Pic.jpg" style="height: 300px;">
    <p>I am a new web developer. I graduated from Southern New Hampshire University with a BS in Video Game Programming and Development</p>
    <p>I have had a passion for all things technology and video games since I was a young kid and decided that I wanted to pursue a career in the tech field. Currently working in IT as a Support Specialist and it has been a blast since everyday provides a learning opportunity and there can always
        be an issue that requires a different solution than the last.
